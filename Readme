Goolf the Golf Ball was based on a single character formed on a golf ball. You had to roll him around the screen, walking onto the springs to make him spring up to the next level and collect the plants.
The Return of Goolf was a second Goolf game based of a see-saw. You had to use the see-saw to catch the falling Goolf and then a falling rock made the see-saw spring Goolf upwards. You had to hit all of the the shapes at the top of the screen to open the exit.
Goolfs Exit was another Goolf game based on springs and levels where you had to reach the end of the maze before the time ran out. This was the last finished Goolf game based on levels.
Bunker Swamp was another game based on the Goolf character. This was a graphic adventure game where you had to type in commands to guide Goolf out of the bunker.
